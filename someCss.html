        <h2 style="font-family:courier;">India has registered a new world record for daily coronavirus infections for the fourth day in a row, placing more strain on its crisis-hit hospitals.

It recorded a further 349,691 cases on Sunday, bringing the total to almost 17 million since the pandemic began.

Overcrowded hospitals are struggling to secure enough oxygen, leading to patients being turned away.

On Saturday the US said it was deeply concerned by India's surge in cases.</h2>

        <h2 style="font-family:verdana;">The US will share up to 60 million doses of its AstraZeneca vaccine with other countries as they become available, the White House has said.

The doses will be able to be exported in the coming months after a federal safety review.

The US has a stockpile of the vaccine even though its regulators have not yet authorised it for public use.

Critics have accused the government of hoarding the vaccine, while other countries are in desperate need.</h2>
